# Shaken-not-Stirred

---

Shaken not Stirred is the brain-child of James Eckman, Emily Ramirez and Efrain Del Campo. We were thinking how that whether in stressful times or times to celebrate, your favorite cocktail (if you're of age) sometimes just pairs perfectly with the current situation. That said, Shaken not Stirred is an alcoholic recipe sharing app where people around the globe can share their favorite drink recipes along with what experiences they go best with. The following features of the app is what makes it a platform that brings people together and potentially can help personal drink experiences live on forever.

- Add a picture of your favorite cocktail.
- Add a detailed list of ingredients and detailed instructions
  on how to mix them.
- Entries can be seen by the public, enhancing the experience of their next party, celebration, or perhaps just the end of a long day at work.
- Sign up with a unique user name and password.
- Login capability that allows you to create personal profiles, saving their favorite recipes and preferences.
- This also allows for enhanced security, user engagement, analytics and content management.
- Lastly, this can set up the ability to add notifications and updates to users about new recipes or comments.
